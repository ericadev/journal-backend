# Journal Backend

Create, read, and delete journal entries after registering or logging in

## Overview

This is the back end for a journal application, where users can register to view the notes in the journal. Users must be set as an admin in the database in order to create, update, or delete journal entries on their own. The live version of the API is on Heroku at https://calm-wildwood-64838.herokuapp.com/ but can only be accessed using an application on localhost or from the front end application I have hosted at https://intense-journey-75173.herokuapp.com/

## Requirements
